# simple-dll-detector
A simple detector of suspicious dlls that can be associated with debuggers, process monitoring tools etc using the Windows API.

Will be improved in a later repo to leverage inline assembly, use of the native API / indirect syscalls, and avoiding creation of a handle to external processes. 

You may use this as an idea to protect your software.
